# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

Solutions for the 2021 [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) puzzles. Starting at Day 2 because I did Day 1 in the Chrome console. I like Lodash, so these might be kind of silly Lodash-heavy implementations.

No error handling or anything like that, enjoy

## Dependencies

- Node (I used v16.10.0) + npm

## Setup

- `npm install`

## Usage

- replace the contents of the relevant day's `input.txt` file with your own (given to you by the AoC website)
    - e.g. if you're solving a Day 2 puzzle, replace `day2/input.txt`
- `node index.js [day] [a or b]`
    - e.g. if you're solving Day 2's second puzzle, `node index.js 2 b`
- your answer will print to the console
